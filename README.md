## Folder Explanations

- **Assets/**  
  Stores *raw* asset files (sprites, textures, tilemaps, fonts, etc.). Organize them by type or usage: Characters, Tilesets, UI, Effects, etc.  
  - **Characters/** – Character sprite sheets, animations, or any character-specific art.  
  - **Tilesets/** – All tile-based assets like tile atlases or tilemaps.  
  - **UI/** – User interface graphics (buttons, icons).  

- **Scenes/**  
  Holds `.tscn` files for different parts of the game (main menu, levels, UI elements).  
  - **MainMenu/** – Scenes and resources for the game’s main menu.  
  - **Levels/** – Each level or room in its own scene.  
  - **UI/** – Scenes that make up the in-game menus, HUD, etc.

- **Scripts/**  
  Contains GDScript or C# (Mono) files that drive the game logic.  
  - **Core/** – Global scripts (like GameManager, singletons, or utility scripts).  
  - **Characters/** – Player, enemy, and AI scripts.  
  - **UI/** – Logic for UI elements (menus, HUD, etc.).

- **Audio/**  
  All sound or music files.  
  - **Music/** – Background music, themes, or loops.  
  - **SFX/** – Sound effects (UI clicks, footsteps, explosions).

- **Addons/**  
  Any Godot addons or plugins you use. These are typically versioned so all collaborators have the same editor extensions.

- **Shaders/**  
  Custom shaders stored in `.shader` or `.gdshader` files for visual effects or rendering logic.

- **Testing/**  
  Automated tests (if used) or test scenes for prototyping or QA.

- **OtherStuff/**  
  A catch-all for anything that doesn’t quite fit the above categories. Rename or remove if unused.
